# Building a Java Container

In this folder you see two files `PingPong.java` and an accompnying `Dockerfile`. Have a look at `PingPong.java` file, can you see what it is doing? Now open the `Dockerfile`, do the lines in Dockerfile look familiar?

Java might not be installed on your machine, fear not, we have Docker, we can build all kinds of docker images now. Knowing what you know now, let's see if you can:

- build a docker image using the `Dockerfile` provided
- run the image using `docker run` command, you will have to map some ports, can you figure out which port the container is running on?
- can you get a `pong` back in your browser by sending a request to the container? hint: you might want to check `PingPong.java` file to see the request to send to the web server.

# Docker Images

In this section, let's dive deeper into what Docker images are. You will build your own image, use that image to run an application locally, and finally, push some of your own images to Docker Cloud.

Docker images are the basis of containers. In the previous examples, you **pulled** some image from the registry and asked the Docker client to run a container **based** on that image. To see the list of images that are available locally on your system, run the `docker images` command.

```bash
$ docker images
REPOSITORY             TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
nginx                  latest              af4b3d7d5401        3 hours ago        190.5 MB
python                 2.7                 1c32174fd534        14 hours ago        676.8 MB
postgres               9.4                 88d845ac7a88        14 hours ago        263.6 MB

```

Above is a list of images that I've pulled from the registry and those I've created myself (we'll shortly see how). You will have a different list of images on your machine. The `TAG` refers to a particular snapshot of the image and the `ID` is the corresponding unique identifier for that image.

For simplicity, you can think of an image akin to a git repository - images can be [committed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/commit/) with changes and have multiple versions. When you do not provide a specific version number, the client defaults to `latest`.

For example you could pull a specific version of `ubuntu` image as follows:

```bash
$ docker pull ubuntu:12.04
```

If you do not specify the version number of the image then, as mentioned, the Docker client will default to a version named `latest`.

So for example, the `docker pull` command given below will pull an image named `ubuntu:latest`:

```bash
$ docker pull ubuntu
```

To get a new Docker image you can either get it from a registry (such as the Docker Store) or create your own. There are hundreds of thousands of images available on [Docker Store](https://store.docker.com). You can also search for images directly from the command line using `docker search`.

An important distinction with regard to images is between _base images_ and _child images_.

- **Base images** are images that have no parent images, usually images with an OS like ubuntu, alpine or debian.

- **Child images** are images that build on base images and add additional functionality.

Another key concept is the idea of _official images_ and _user images_. (Both of which can be base images or child images.)

- **Official images** are Docker sanctioned images. Docker, Inc. sponsors a dedicated team that is responsible for reviewing and publishing all Official Repositories content. This team works in collaboration with upstream software maintainers, security experts, and the broader Docker community. These are not prefixed by an organization or user name. In the list of images above, the `python`, `node`, `alpine` and `nginx` images are official (base) images. To find out more about them, check out the [Official Images Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_repos/).

- **User images** are images created and shared by users like you. They build on base images and add additional functionality. Typically these are formatted as `user/image-name`. The `user` value in the image name is your Docker Store user or organization name.
